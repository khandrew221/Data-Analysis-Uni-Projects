As we discussed in Part 8, the `prescription` table contains information about prescriptions, but it also contains data about patients, drugs, and doctors via the primary key. However, in the original Hospital database, most of the information about these entities was divided into separate tables. The structure of the unnormalised `unnormalised_prescription` table means that we are often prevented from dealing with these entities independently.\n",

Again, this is because the unnormalised data contains copies of these other entities, rather than splitting them out into different tables.\n",
