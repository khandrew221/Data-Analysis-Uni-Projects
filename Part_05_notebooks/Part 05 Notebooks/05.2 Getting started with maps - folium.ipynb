    "One of the most powerful - and intuitive - visualisation techniques for location-based data is to make use of maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The technical subject of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is a very broad one, but at its core are systems specifically tailored for the storage, display, interrogation and management of geographic, location-related data. The common feature of all GIS is the central role that location plays in the data - acting as a key to draw together data from different sources and forming the main relationship between data elements.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Latitiude and longitude values can be used to determine a point on the Earth's surface, but these are not the only coordinate systems that could be used.  There is also the problem that the Earth's spherical representation makes it difficult to accurately represent both area and shape when working on a flat surface (screen or paper).  For this reason different projections are available that convert the spherical reality of the Earth's surface to the flat representation of our screens and atlases and, similar to choosing an appropriate visualisation for graphic data, choosing a suitable projection for mapping data can be important.  So, simply plotting the latitude and longitude position on a grid is not sufficient: a mathematical transformation to the chosen projection is required.  These and other complex issues (handling height above sea level, mapping areas as well as points) are concerns in mapping and GIS.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this introduction we're going to take a GIS-lite approach to maps.  We're going to use a library that has a single projection, and uses 'raw' latitude and longitude values for points on the map. We're also using maps to support the visualisation of data (rather than for capturing data), so we're interested in how to present data on the maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are typically three - or four, depending how you count them - ways of representing data on a map:\n",
    "\n",
    "- points, or markers\n",
    "- lines\n",
    "- regions, or shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The _fourth_ way is to use proportional symbol markers - that is, markers such as circles whose size is proportional to some quantity relevant to the marker location.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several libraries available that can help us work with maps. One approach is to generate base maps using graphic visualisation libraries such as matplotlib to form quick, static sketch maps. If we require interactive JavaScript style maps, we can use the mplleaflet library to convert these static map representations to embedded interactive ones using the leaflet JavaScript library. Another is to use a package such as *folium* to create a leaflet map directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll look at ways of representing location data with the _folium_ package, which integrates Python and _pandas_ data handling interactive, leaflet JavaScript, maps.  folium handles a lot of the underlying details, letting us get on with presenting our location-based data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The use of a package like folium is a compromise between the full power of the packages it uses and the flexibility and complexity of the features you can use in the full leaflet library.  \n",

In other cases, you may be presented with a geodata file, such as a _KML_ file or _geojson_ file, that includes semantically declared geographical data points. These allow you to ingest the data files and use these values directly.\n",

One common approach is to use postcode data and a lookup service such as such as [postcodes.io](https://postcodes.io/). This site provides an API that allows you to look up UK postcode information programmatically; it also publishes an interactive map that lets you identify lat/long co-ordinates more generally (https://postcodes.io/explore). Postcode lookups typically return the centroid of the area covered by the postcode which allows us to plot a marker within several tens or hundreds of meters of the actual location of an address.

    "So my approach to generating the MK postcode boundaries file was to start at the above site, choosing the _England_, _Postal_, _2012_ boundary data and using the _List Area_ feature to choose just the Milton Keynes data.  When I'd picked the data I wanted, I used the _format_ tab to select KML format for the output file.  Once I'd downloaded the output file I needed to convert the KML to GeoJSON.\n",

    "The interactive service http://ogre.adc4gis.com/ does this; the output from this is displayed to your browser page but it is possible to save this to a file.  A quick check with OpenRefine (open the file as a JSON format file) shows this parsed correctly, and allowed me to look for the property name used for the Districts - in this case `properties.Name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "All this is very manual and rather clunky; but for this investigation/example it worked, and didn't take me more than 30 minutes of web searching to find the repository and the ogre service, with a couple of false starts.  Next time it'll take less than 5 minutes if the repository contains the boundary data I need.\n",
