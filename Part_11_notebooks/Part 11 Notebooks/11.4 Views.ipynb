As we saw in section 3 of Part 11, a view is defined as *a query with a name*. Once created, it is available for use in any other query: it becomes usable in exactly the same way as a table. This means that a complex query can be written once, its result stored as a view, and then that view be used in subsequent queries.\n",

    "In some of the above queries, the `COALESCE` function returned the first non-NULL job role. Note the bias built into the query of the male job being tested first. It can be very easy to unconsciously build possible bias in to a query, although in this case it should have no effect (we have an exclusive-OR case of either male job or female job).\n",
    "\n",
    "The query also includes a full outer join, which means we take data from each table if there is no join condition. If we were using an explicit or implied left join, we would be biasing our result to the left table, i.e. towards the `male_jobs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might argue that a biased query is an incorrect query, but this would be a mistake: it is often the case that a query will unavoidably reflect some bias in the question, the query writer or the database. After all, very often you will not be able to go back and collect the data that you would have liked. However, it is absolutely vital that you should consistently review your queries to try to identify any biases that may exist (or error from mistaken assumptions). Then either try to remove them, or ensure that your final analysis is explicit about any limitations which may arise from the biases you have identified.\n",
