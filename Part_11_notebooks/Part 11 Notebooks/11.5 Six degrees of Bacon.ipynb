As with so many things in the pragmatics of database use, whether to use materialised views, and to what degree, is an exercise in judgment with consideration of the different demands on the database."

    "This notebook has been an investigation into materialised views. You've seen how they represent a trade-off between time and space. Materialised views can allow a database to quickly return the results of a complex and time-consuming query, by caching the results of that query in the materialsed view. The downsides are the space needed to create them, and the issue of out-of-date information if the underlying tables change before the materialised view is regnerated."
