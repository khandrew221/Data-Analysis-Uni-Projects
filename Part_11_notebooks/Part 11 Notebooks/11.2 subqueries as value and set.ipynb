    "This notebook has shown you how to use subqueries as values or sets of values in a query. As you have seen, this allows you to express more sophisticated queries in just SQL, without having to import large result sets into Pandas and then do some additional processing there. The more data manipulation you can get the database to do, the better. This has advantages both in processing time and also in memory usage: RDBMSs are very good at handling large sets of data, and can often do it more efficiently than Pandas.\n",
